# Monocular-Depth-Map-Estimation

## Overview
1. Implemented the paper, **High Quality Monocular Depth Estimation via Transfer Learning** to construct a depth map using a single image frame of a particular scene.
2. Incorporated augmentations into the image dataset to introduce and random horizontal flips during model training.
3. The model consisted of an UNet architecture with Densenet169 as a pre-trained encoder and a custom decoder.
4. Implemented a custom loss function incorporating edge loss, depth loss and Structural Similarity loss. 
5. Trained the model in PyTorch on a NYU2 Depth dataset and achieved an accuracy of
